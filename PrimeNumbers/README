PrimeNumbers project:

PrimeNumberExec.java contains the main method, instantiating the class WindowMap.

WindowMap is responsible for creating the GUI for the program and for all further operations in this program. 
Taking a given range of integers from user input, the WindowMap objects finds and displays a list of all the 
prime numbers in the specified range. The object uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes method for finding primes.  

NOTE: it is not at all ideal to handle all calculations and GUI operations in a single class.
